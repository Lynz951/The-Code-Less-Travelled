    <h1>Week 6</h1>
    <h2>Q & A with Lindsay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>This is a hard question. It is impossible to list all of the things that I have learned this week, and most big picture ideas are extremely hard to put into words. We watched an example of a white board interview which helped me understand how developers think through problems. I am also starting to understand the different types of coding.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b> What does it mean to develop good code?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>Good code is lots of things. It is easy to read and follow. Every line has a purpose and isn't repeated a million times. Elements are labeled correctly and put in the right place in the file, with all other similar elements. Also, it works.</q>

    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Q & A with Lindsay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>Due to this being the first week of in-person, the main thing that held me back in class was my endurance. I was very tired most days, which affected my ability work with clarity and precision. I wish I could have done more work at home, but by the time I had a chance I was simply just too tired. I think that the longer I am in the program and the more that I practice I will be able to work faster and for a longer period of time each day. I hope so at least!</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I woud like to learn much more about Bootstrap. I love making my projects asthetically pleasing and well organized. I think that Bootstrap is an awesome tool.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>In-Person Bootcamp is such a fun, immursive experience. I feel like I have learned so much this week. I also like the collaborations that I have participated in. The collaborations between my classmates have also been benefitial to me, just by eavesdropping when I can. I feel like I am working really well with the people that sit around me, which is very encouraging. I felt very alone in my desert of despair while Onboarding. I will say that Onboarding was benefitial in building up my mental endurance for in-person. </q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What is your "Why"?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>My "why" for taking this bootcamp, and working so hard, is myself. I have spent the last 12 years mainly focused on my children. They are finally at an age when they don't need me as much. I am so ready for my own identity to come back, even if it is completely different than before. I want to be useful for something other than parenting.

    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Q & A with Lindsay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I benefitted a ton from the standups. I loved getting little lessons from the instructors. I also liked the comradery and support.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>Nothing really hindered my progress. I think I should have spent more time studying.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>When I had challenges during Onboarding I would usually google my problem. Then, if I hadn't found the answer I would ask #help on Slack or someone during the next standup.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Sidenote: While talking about something completely unrelated to coding class my mom said something that really has kept me going. I thought I would share it here.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Me: "Wow, that must be hard."<br>
            My mom: “Yeah, but that’s OK, I can do hard.”</i>
        <br>
        <br>
I am so glad to have been raised by someone with this mentality. Sometimes when I hear someone won’t do something, even though they want to, or know it’s the right thing to do, because it will be hard, I am surprised. I don’t love doing hard things anymore than most people, but I’m not afraid of hard. I don’t think just because something will be hard is a reason not to do it. I actually like doing hard things. I feel proud when I complete them. I feel like I have done something special. I did the hard thing and survived. What’s next? </li>

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Q & A with Lindsay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I like using HTML and CSS better than just Markdown because I feel like I have more control over format. JavaScript is scary, but I can see the endless possibilities!</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I don't know if there are any objects. Would classes count?</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I love pseudocoding. As a visiual learner who loves writing things down to organize my thoughts, it just makes sense.</q>
